## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-28

## Release v0.4.0

This release introduces significant improvements to the download experience, enhanced Windows compatibility, and new command-line features for streamlined automation.

### üöÄ New Features

- **Rich Progress Bars**: Implemented beautiful, real-time progress visualization using the Rich library, showing individual chapter progress with time estimates and completion percentages.
- **Direct URL Downloads**: Added `--url` argument to bypass the interactive interface entirely for direct audiobook downloads.
- **Bypassing Search UI**: Introduced `--search` flag to perform searches non-interactively without requiring user input.
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Overhauled the download system to use FFmpeg for downloading HLS streams and converting them to high-quality MP3 files, with integrated progress tracking.
- **Multi-threaded Progress Tracking**: Enhanced parallel downloading with sophisticated progress monitoring, including status icons (queued ‚è≥ ‚Üí running üîÑ ‚Üí done ‚úÖ) and detailed metrics.

### üîß Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved robustness in download operations and user interaction flows.
- **Custom Directory Support**: Better handling of custom download directories.
- **Logging Enhancements**: More comprehensive logging for better troubleshooting.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Windows Compatibility**: Replaced deprecated `pick` library with `questionary` and added conditional imports to fix Windows compatibility issues.
- **Search API Fixes**: Resolved issues with book search functionality and result pagination.
- **Player URL Update**: Adapted to changes in TokyBook's player API endpoint.
- **Dependency Pinning**: Fixed questionary version to 2.1.1 to resolve runtime bugs.
- **Race Condition Fix**: Resolved critical race condition in progress updates by moving shutdown checks inside lock context to prevent UI corruption during multi-threaded operations.
- **Thread-Safe Shutdown**: Fixed shutdown behavior during concurrent downloads with better synchronization prevents state corruption.
- **Progress State Consistency**: Eliminated state corruption issues during concurrent operations and shutdown sequences.

### üîí Dependencies & Requirements

- Added Rich library for enhanced terminal UI
- Added FFmpeg requirement (must be installed and available in PATH)
- Updated questionary to version 2.1.1

**Breaking Changes**: FFmpeg is now required to run TokySnatcher. Users without FFmpeg should install it separately.

### üìã Compatibility

- Full backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
- Windows compatibility restored
- Maintains support for macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like systems
